AI could be used to help build a search engine for mathematical literature that recognizes concepts (Tim Gowers suggested this idea a number of years ago with the hopes that such an engine would speed up research, having had several instances where he had a concept in mind but had no way to query the literature without knowing how such a concept, if already in existence, had been named).  This would be a huge achievement, so the task that follows is just a possible component of the larger project.  The task would be:  Given two research papers (it may be necessary to restrict this to short papers or even paragraphs initially), identify whether there are conceptual similarities (defining exactly what constitutes a conceptual similarity will take some careful thought) in the papers.  The data would consist of pairs of journal papers, some of which have been identified to have similarities and others which are considered dissimilar.  For this task, supervised learning using natural language processing would be appropriate.  It would be important for the NLP part to be able to parse symbolic notation.  Since Category Theory has a reputation for unifying different branches of mathematics by identifying conceptual similarities, it could be incorporated into the model as domain knowledge.  Success would be measured by the accuracy of the model on the test set.
